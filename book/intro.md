# Polaritons
The topic of this research project is the study of the population, energy and stability dynamics of cavity polariton arrays optomechanically coupled to cavity phonons. Schematically the process creates a polariton pair by cascading down a ladder of polaritonic states via phonon emission, the initial polaritonic population is generated via coherent or incoherent pumping on a state of high energy. Due to the backaction between the polaritonic and phononic field, the outcome of this whole process is the coherent phonon generation in the cavity thus rendering this system as a phonon cascade laser (PCQL).

This project has been done under the supervision of Prof. Gonzalo Usaj of the Condensed Matter Theory Department at the Bariloche Atomic Center (C.A.B.). The motivation for this project arises from experimental finding in the Optics and Photonics group at C.A.B., which have found the strong coupling between polaritonic cavity modes via phonons in a wedged cavity.
