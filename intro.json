Schematically the process creates a polariton pair by cascading down a ladder of polaritonic states via phonon emission, the initial polaritonic population is generated via coherent or incoherent pumping on a state of high energy. Due to the backaction between the polaritonic and phononic field, the outcome of this whole process is the coherent phonon generation in the cavity thus rendering this system as a phonon cascade laser (PCQL).","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":1}},"key":"twEqoKYJpb"}],"key":"kAjJR5K2A5"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This project has been done under the supervision of Prof. Gonzalo Usaj of the Condensed Matter Theory Department at the Bariloche Atomic Center (C.A.B.).
