# Presentation
The topics of this research project are the population, energy and stability dynamics of cavity polariton arrays optomechanically coupled via cavity phonons. Schematically the process creates exciton-polaritons by cascading down a ladder of polaritonic states via phonon emission. The initial polaritonic population is generated via coherent or incoherent pumping on a state of high energy. Due to the backaction between the polaritonic and phononic field, the outcome of this whole process is the coherent phonon generation in the cavity thus rendering this system as a phonon cascade laser (PCQL).
## Cavity polaritons and cavity phonons 
Cavity polaritons are mixed quasi particles born from the combination of a photon and some crystal excitation. In our case we'll concern us with Wannier-Mott excitons which are a hydrogen-like bound states originated from the Coulomb interaction between a conduction band electron and a valence band hole. Due to a very strong collective dipole interaction between these excitons and the microcavity photon fields, a strong light-matter coupling is achieved and anticrossing in both component's disperssions is observed at their degeneracy points see [Figure 1(a)](fig-polariton-cavity). This originates two bands called the lower and upper polariton branches ([Deng2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.82.1489)). Their mixed nature conferes a very interesting set of properties to these quasiparticles like high temperature Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity and other qualities that belong to the realm of the quantum fluids of light ([Carusotto2012](https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.85.299)).

Realizations of polaritonic systems require the confinement of both their light and excitonic components. The former condition can be obtained by the use of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) which creates a reflection profile that bounces some frequency range (stopband) and lets in a sharply defined middle frequency, see [Figure 1(b)](fig-polariton-cavity). In some structures, this DBR generates an analog profile for the lattice vibrations (phonons) thus also confining these in the process ([Trigo2002](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.227402)). Confinement in one of the excitonic component's dimensions is provided by the use of quantum wells (QWs) by the alternation of semiconductors with different bandgaps (for example GaAS and AlGaAs). By etching the heterostructure in other geometrical patterns it's possible to generate confinement in directions perpendicular to the growth axis, see [Figure 1(c)](fig-polariton-cavity). In this way localized polaritonic modes along the heterostructure are generated and, by careful parameter engineering, it's possible to tune their respective energies and couplings. For example, by tuning the trap's size, it's possible to create a cascade-like structure like the one depicted in [Figure 1(d)](fig-polariton-cavity).

Appart from providing some polariton relaxation mechanisms, phonons can interact with the polariton field producing a set of phenomena like optomechanically induced tunneling, self sustained mechanical oscillations above some threshold and frequency locking ([Reynoso2022](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.195310), [Chafatinos2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38788-9)) which are of interest for the present research. In particular, we'll be concerned with a system where many spatially extended modes are confined in a single trap which induces a linear coupling on the phonon's coordinate. To enhance the phonon dependent coupling, the trap is tuned to make each of the polariton modes be separated in energy in an ammount similar to the phonon's frequency ([Papuccio2025](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.17336)).

## Model preliminaries
Modeling of non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates ([Wouters2007](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.140402)) of this sort is done using a *generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation*:
(gpe-equation)=
$$
i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left\{ -\frac{\hbar \nabla^2}{2m_{LP}} + \frac{i}{2}[R(n_R) - \gamma] + U \vert \psi \vert^2\right\}\psi + F(\vec r, t),
$$
whose main feautures that separate it from a traditional Schrödinger equation is the introduction of dissipative, self interaction (Hartree), and driving terms. For the latter the condensate can be subject to incoherent (non resonant) driving by means of an exciton reservoir whose population relaxes by many mechanisms through the lower polariton branch. This process is described phenomenologically by an independent equation for the reservoir population:
(reservoir-equation)=
$$
\frac{\partial n_R}{\partial t} = P - \gamma_R n_R - R(n_R)\vert \psi(\vec r) \vert^2 + D \nabla^2 n_R
$$
where $P$ is the rate of increase in the reservoir population given by the driving. In general relaxation times in reservoirs are much shorter than that of exciton-polaritons, and thus an adiabatic approximation is valid ($\partial_t n_R = 0$). Alternatively coherent driving at the condensate's resonant frequency can be supplied by $F(\vec r, t) \propto e^{i\omega_d t}$. Condensate-reservoir coupling is introuduced by the function $R(n_R)$, for the purposes of this research we'll consider a linear coupling given by $R(n_R) = R\times n_R$ where $R$ measures the strength of such coupling.
## Details of the model
In absence of driving and dissipation, our model may be first described as a Bose-Hubbard model with phonon state dependent hoppings:
(schematic-hamiltonian)=
$$
\hat{\mathcal H} = \sum_{i}\hbar \omega_i \hat a^\dag_i \hat a_i + \frac{1}{2}\sum_i \hbar U_i \hat a_i^\dag \hat a_i (\hat a^\dag_i \hat a_i -1) + \sum_k \hbar \Omega_k \hat b^\dag_k \hat b_k + \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}\hbar \hat J_{ij} (\hat a^\dag_i \hat a_j + \hat a^\dag_j \hat a_i),
$$
with $\hat b_k^\dag$ ($\hat b_k$) creation (destruction) operator of a phonon with frequency $\Omega_k$, $\langle i, j \rangle$ denotes summation over coupled modes and $\hat J_{ij} = J^0_{ij} + g_{ij} (\hat b^\dag_{k(ij)} + \hat b_{k(ij)})$ where $k(ij)$ denotes the phonon which couples modes $i$ and $j$. Generally, there may be phonons which couple multiple polariton mode pairs so that $k(ij) = k(i'j')$. This **tight-binding approximation** might be derived from two possible scenarios:

1. The polariton modes are localized in a discrete lattice and the $\hat a_i^\dag$ ($\hat a_i$) creation (destruction) operators act upon localized modes in that lattice.
2. The polariton modes may not be localized in a lattice and the equation is derived by projecting the associated Schrödinger equation (in absence of phonons) to the (lowest) eigenmodes of energies $\hbar \omega_i$. Orthogonality of the eigenmodes in this case gives $J^0_{ij} = 0$.

As we'll concern ourselves with solutions with large number of quanta, the **semiclassical approximation** is applyable. This consists of replacing all bosonic operators by complex functions
(semiclassical-approx)=
$$
\hat a_i \rightarrow a_i,\quad \hat a_i^\dag \rightarrow a_i^*, \quad \hat b_k \rightarrow b_k, \quad \hat b_k^\dag \rightarrow b_k^* 
$$
after that we may derive an equation of motion for the phonon's generalized position operator $\hat x_k = \hat b_k + \hat b_k^\dag$ using the Heisenberg's picture (HP) and then applying the semiclassical approximation. Additionaly we may introduce some linear loss term on the phonon velocity operator with loss rate $\Gamma_k$. Finally we introduce driving and dissipation terms in each mode's HP equation of motion corresponding to the ones appearing in the [GPE](gpe-equation). Thus the **model equations** are:
(model-polariton-equation)=
$$
i\dot a_i = \left\{\omega_i + \frac{i}{2}(R_i n_i - \gamma_i) + U_i \vert a_i \vert^2\right\} a_i + F_i e^{i\omega_{d}^i t}+\sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \left(J^0_{ij} + g_{ij} x_{k(ij)}\right)a_j
$$
(model-phonon-equation)=
$$
\ddot x_k = -\Omega_k^2 x_k - \Gamma_k \dot x_k - \sum_{(i, j) \in G_k} 2\Omega_k g_{ij}(a_i a_j^* + a_i^* a_j)
$$
where $G_k$ is the set of pairs of polariton modes which are coupled by phonon $k$. In most cases we'll concern ourselves with the experimentally relevant case where the phonon has a sharply defined frequency, polariton mode's widths are small compared to their energy separations and the latter are comparable to the phonon energy so that stimulated phonon emission and absorption is enhanced:
(orders-of-magnitude)=
$$
\Gamma_k \ll \gamma_i \ll \Omega_k,\quad \forall i, k
$$
(quasi-resonant-condition)=
$$
\Omega_k \sim \vert \omega_i - \omega_j\vert,\quad \forall (i,j) \in G_k
$$
