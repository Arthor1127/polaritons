# Cavity polaritons coupled to cavity phonons
Research repository on the subject of cavity polaritons optomechanically coupled to cavity phonons in linear arrays. We explore the population and energy dynamics of these systems on the contex of the research done in the Optics and Photonics group in the Bariloche Atomic Center. This work has been done under the supervision of Prof. Gonzalo Usaj of the Condensed Matter Theory group. 
# Objectives
The main objectives for this work are
1. Explore the polariton and phonon population dynamics of these arrays under different driving protocols and different intensities
2. Explore the energy spectrum dynamics of the system in terms of the driving
3. Understand the stability of the different regimes observed under this model.
